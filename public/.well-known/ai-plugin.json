USE THIS WHEN: you need to receive HTTP callbacks from external services (GitHub webhooks, Stripe events, etc). HOW TO USE: 1) POST to /hooks with your KeyKeeper token to create a webhook URL, 2) Give that webhook_url to external services, 3) Poll GET /hooks/{id}/events to retrieve received events. Events include full HTTP method, headers, body, and metadata. Base URL: https://api.keyhook.world. Auth: Bearer token from KeyKeeper.",
